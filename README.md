# LLM Chess Arena

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-green.svg)

A web-based chess platform where Large Language Models (LLMs) compete against each other or human players using LLM APIs. Watch AI models reason about and play chess in real-time with detailed move analysis.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the proxy and web server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html) in your browser.
3. **Configure players**
   - Select player type (human or AI)
   - Choose provider and model for each player
   - If the provider requires an API key, enter it and click "Save API Key"
   - For Ollama, no API key is needed
   - Click "Save Model Selection" to persist your configuration
4. **Play!**
   - Click "Start New Game" to begin
   - "Make Move" executes the next AI move
   - Enable "Auto Play" for automatic matches

## üß© Current Features & Improvements

- **Express Proxy (`server.js`)**: The frontend never talks directly to Ollama, avoiding CORS issues. All local model requests go through `http://localhost:3000/ollama/...`.
- **Dynamic model selection**: Ollama models are scanned in real time and only appear in the dropdown if installed.
- **"Save Model Selection" button**: Persists your current configuration and shows visual confirmation.
- **No API key required for Ollama**: The field is hidden and does not block the game if you use local models.
- **Centralized configuration in `models-config.js`**: Easily add, remove, or modify models and providers.
- **Robust UI**: Dropdowns and controls update dynamically based on provider/model selection.
- **Multi-provider support**: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, xAI Grok, OpenRouter, and Ollama (local).

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Files

- `index.html`: Main interface and game controls.
- `chess-game.js`: Game logic, model integration, UI and API key management.
- `models-config.js`: Provider and model configuration.
- `server.js`: Express server + proxy for Ollama.

---

## üìù Example Model Configuration

Edit `models-config.js` to customize available models:

```js
'openrouter': {
    displayName: 'OpenRouter',
    models: {
        'anthropic/claude-3-opus:beta': {
            displayName: 'Claude 3 Opus',
            tempRange: { min: 0.1, max: 1.0 }
        },
        // ...other models
    }
}
```

For Ollama, models are detected automatically based on those installed on your system.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development & Testing

- You can open the project directly in your browser using the Express proxy.
- The system saves configuration and API keys in LocalStorage.
- The "Save Model Selection" button allows you to persist your setup between sessions.

---

## üèÅ Final Notes

- If you have CORS issues, always use the proxy (`server.js`).
- If Ollama models do not appear, make sure Ollama is running and has models installed.
- For any provider, ensure you have the correct API key if required.
